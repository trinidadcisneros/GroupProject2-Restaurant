Work on "#sample-metadata"
-This panel will display the restaurant information for any restaurant that is selected
from the map
-will need to respond to the map selection
-get the marker detail
-add it to this section

for now:
-look at how hw15 feed metadata by js to website
-hard code the restaurant entry

-will need to hardcode to display on the index.html without having to do the go through the @app.route metadata/businessid because this opens up the json display and not the index html with the code.
-look at hw15 again
-the init function should give it the info it needs and then it will respond when selections are made by the user.


UPDATE
-create new function in js that gets the restaurant information from the map
-this function will be in the init function
-and will call on the metadata function and feed in the business Id

Start with creating the route-
hard coding a business_id
put it in the init and see if this works
